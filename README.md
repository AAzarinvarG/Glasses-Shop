## Hi 🤚
I have created a Responsive Store Project for Sunglasses 👓
 using html css js which is a practice project with js

### Links 🔗 to the sites where I used icons and box-shadows in the project:
{ [box shadow](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) }
{ [icon](https://ionic.io/ionicons) }


### Project features 👀


- Add products to cart ➕
- Price interview in the shopping cart 🧮
- Saving the products in the shopping cart in local storage📍
